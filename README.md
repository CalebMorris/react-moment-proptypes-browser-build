# ReactMomentProptypes Browser Build

A simple [Webpack] bundled version of [react-moment-proptypes].

## Example
See [Example HTML in Example.html](https://github.com/CalebMorris/react-moment-proptypes-browser-build/blob/master/example.html) ([rendered](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CalebMorris/react-moment-proptypes-browser-build/master/example.html)).

## Caveats
This is a simple non-minified bundle that is currently used to simplify browser-based testing.

I don't recommend directly using in production.
